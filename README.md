# FreshEats

### Functionality
This is an application that acts like a meal kit subscription plan. It allows users with little or no experience with cooking to be able to prepare fresh and 
healthy meals from the comfort of their home by following simple recipes of their choice from weekly generated presets. There will be some flexibility when it comes to editing the recipes in order to fit certain dietary restrictions. 
Also, the application takes the user's budget for groceries/ingredients in mind, as well as how much time they are willing to spend cooking per week.

### Target Audience
This application is generally for anyone who is trying to eat **fresh** and **healthy** home-cooked meals. However, it is aimed towards 
university students who are having trouble balancing their daily meal intake due to their 
heavy workload and inexperience with time management.

### Inspiration
As a university student who had just recently moved far away from the comfort of my own home where I could eat my mother's delicious home-cooked meal, to living alone and trying to avoid eating junk food three times  a day. I found it quite difficult to find a healthy work-life 
balance where I can eat a fresh nutritious meal and get all my assignments done. I am a very firm believer in the fact that 
a healthy body leads to a healthy mind, and the first step towards that is watching what you eat. So, I thought of how much easier it could be if I knew the exact ingredients I needed for the meals I wanted to cook every week, which would save me both time and money. 
In conclusion, this is a problem I am personally facing and I hope this project acts as a solution for anyone else encountering the same issue.
